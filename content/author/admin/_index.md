That's me on the left: I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in mathematics, which means I'm trying to prove the intersection of my writings/wanderings  and scholarly output is nonempty--while teaching (MATH 1316, currently). See my vita for progress on this problem. <br>
On the right is American Mathematical Society President Ken Ribet in Rio!
